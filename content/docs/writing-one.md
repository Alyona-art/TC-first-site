# Technical documentation review: key points and tips

Writing a clear and good technical documentation is important for any product development process. However, documents review may be a critical part to ensure that the outcomes meet the goal and to minimize inconsistent and missing information. This text describes the steps to effectively review technical document.

## Define a goal

Take a quick look at the text to understand the purpose of the document. This will help you prioritize what to evaluate first and determine the verification criteria. Documents intended for different audiences and carrying different information will have different review processes.

> For example, the purpose of the **user manual** is to deliver accurate and complete information about the product and its features to the end user. Therefore, you need to carefully check the usability of the document and simplify the text for understanding by people with any background.

> On the other hand, an **internal code standards document** is intended for the development team, so the goal is to be well-informed of the rules and regulations in the code standards after reading. And the information should be of high quality rather than just nice to look at.

## A review team

Define a review team that will analyze the documents. Pick people from different fields to get comprehensive feedback. Here's an example of review teams:

### Technical writer review

An internal check among the technical writing team that helps to identify logical inconsistencies and moreover exchange some good practices and knowledge.

### Developer review

Review of the correctness of the facts and the clear sequence of instructions that is carried out by the people involved in the development process.

### Stakeholder review

The document is checked by support staff or end users to predict parts that users may have problems with.

### Compliance review

A document used by a wide audience must be reviewed by a legal team and comply with company, industry or government rules and regulations.

## Checklist

Create a checklist for review. A structured plan will help cover all parts and ensure the quality of the documentation. We listed the main things to look for when conducting a review.

- **Content** – verify the information, all tables and diagrams to make sure that it is complete and relevant.
- **Structure** – review if structure is easy to follow and there is a logical flow of information.
- **Language** – check if language is appropriate and easy to read for intended audience. Text shouldn't contain any grammar and spelling errors.
- **Compliance** – review that document complies with safety standards, environmental regulations, or data protection laws.
- **References** – check if the cited references are up-to-date.
- **Consistency** – verify that text is consistent in terminology, formatting, and style.
- **Usability** – test usability especially if document is created for end-users.

Or you can use one of the off-the-shelf checklists for convenience, as long as it fits the purpose of your documentation.
